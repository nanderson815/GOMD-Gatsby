  Georgia on my Dime - V2
</h1>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
Georgia on my Dime is the largest and most utilized happy hour website in Atlanta. We connect customers the best restaurants in the city. Over the past 3 years, Georgia on my Dime has grown to 10,000 monthly unique visitors and represents hundreds of restaurants in Atlanta.

<h3>Problem</h3>
GOMD has outgrown its initial website. Pages need to load faster and be geared towards a mobile browsing experience. Additionally, the dated technologies used to build the site are hampering growth and the ability to add new features.

<h3>Solution</h3>
A completely rebuilt website that utilizes React, Gatsby, and Contentful to deliver blazing performance, an improved UI, and brand-new features to help connect customers to restaurants. GOMD V2 is still under construction â€“ feel free to check out the code above to track our progress!
